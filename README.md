# Deforestation-Exploration_Project

Following the analysis carried out to explore the World Bank data on deforestation around the world, it was found that between 1990 and 2016, there was a 3.2% decrease in the level of forestation. In order words, several activities which led to an increase in deforestation have been carried out.
It was found that the top 5 countries including Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mauritania, and Honduras which had decreased in the forestation area are from the Sub-Saharan Africa region. Activities which contributed to a high level of deforestation have to be put in check in order to encourage forestation.
Generally, we could see from the different quartiles generated that a higher number of countries are distributed in Q1 to Q3, while only 9 countries had their forestation equal to or higher than 75%, most of which are from the East Asia & Pacific region. More awareness has to be created to make known the importance of forestation in order to see significant changes in the coming years.
